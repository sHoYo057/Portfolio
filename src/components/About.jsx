        I’m a data analyst with hands-on experience in ETL, feature engineering, visualization, and deploying models.
        I’ve worked on churn prediction, retail forecasting, and end-to-end analytics pipelines. I focus on clarity — making
        data-driven recommendations recruiters and product teams can act on.
